This is code to demonstrate my PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML, and CSS coding abilities.

connectDB.php has been removed as it contains sensitive information used to connect to the MySQL database.

I will not include a link to the webpage this code is for as it is vulnerable to SQL injection and malicious actions.
